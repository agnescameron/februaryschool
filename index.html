<b>To Cambridge With Love, MIT
February 14th, 3-5pm, Wiesner Gallery, (W20-209)
Laura Perovich & Lillian Hsu</b>
<br>How do MIT and Cambridge interact as institutions and individuals? What kind of power structures inform their relationships? This workshop will investigate the MIT and Cambridge relationship and explore new methods for engagement on local challenges such as justice, environment, city planning, health, public space, education, and more. Community and city representatives will join us to explore first steps to beginning new collaborative projects together. Since the NECCO conversation hearts are gone, we’ll decorate cookies with messages from MIT to Cambridge and Cambridge to MIT establishing our relationship...and eat these cookies to internalize our new future together! 

Laura Perovich, PhD Candidate, MIT Media Lab.
Lillian Hsu, Director of Public Art and Exhibitions, Cambridge Arts Council.

<b>Pixilate: A Spontaneous Collective Animation Workshop
February 17th, 12-1.30pm, Wiesner Gallery (W20-209)
Samuel Mendez </b>
<br>In this workshop, participants will receive a basic introduction to the mechanics of pixilation: stop-motion animation using human body movement. Then, they will learn through creating a short animation collaboratively, one photo at a time, using only body movement. This workshop aims to expose anyone interested to a budget-friendly animation technique, and expand all participants’ notions of what can be said without words. No previous formal artistic experience necessary. Comfortable clothes recommended. 

Samuel Mendez is a Master’s student in the Department of Comparative Media Studies at MIT.

<b>An Analog Interface in a Digital World
Opening February 18th, 6pm, Wiesner Gallery (W20-209)
Kalli Retzepi</b>
<br>Branden Hookway describes the interface as a “form of relation”. As interfaces increasingly work by inserting themselves in our subconscious ways of being, this short photographic exploration probes the nature of our encounters with them by creating a dialogue between digital and analog interfaces, and asks, given our techno-cultural context, what the consequences of these momentary mediations are. 

Kalli Retzepi is a graduate student at the Media Lab. She uses technology, design and images in order to explore the politics of digital interfaces, the narrative of the user and to imagine new metaphors for the Web.

<b>Skip Read Open Studio
February 22nd, 6.30-8.30pm, Wiesner Gallery 
Billy Foshay</b>
<br>Skip reading is an adaptation of William Borough’s “cut-up method” that allows readers to skip freely around different portions of a text to create new non-linear interpretations. The goal is to surpass the linearity of reading by rearranging words through the readers’ discretion to composite a new text. Participants are encouraged to bring in a text of their choosing they wish to be skip read. This could be writing of their own or of another - a textbook, a poem, a paper, an online review, an email, etc. Each skip read text will require three readers, and therefore 3 electronic copies of the text. The readers will take turns reading a selected portion of the text - the next reader picking up where the previous left off and continuing the cycle until the group feels the composite is complete. The audio will be captured with microphones and recording devices. 

Billy Foshay is an MFA candidate at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

<b>Gardening Workshop 
February 27th, 10am-1pm, Wiesner Gallery (W20-209)
Laura Knott</b>
<br>It may seem that gardeners are growing tomatoes, or zucchini, or pumpkins, corn and beans. But the best gardeners are growing soil. And, in the meantime, they’re growing communities of bacteria and fungi and, sometimes, of neighbors and friends. This workshop brings together textual references and a little dirt, to think together about food, seeds, and gardening as a generative and regenerative action. 

Laura Knott is an artist, curator, editor and author, specializing in work at the intersection of art and technology. She is also an alumna of the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies.

<b>Ecosystem: The Sentence Versos the Line and the Line Verses the Sentence
February 27th, 2-4pm, Wiesner Gallery (W20-209)
Kevin McLellan</b>
<br>We must consider that each line of poetry is an independent division of information that has the ability to accommodate both separation and wholeness, yet each line also informs or speaks to the abutting lines, thus challenging: the sentence, the sentence’s preoccupations, and the reader’s expectations. In this seminar we will contemplate the sentence and the line; participate in a relevant writing prompt; and then engage in discussion. 

Kevin McLellan is the author of Hemispheres (Fact-Simile Editions, forthcoming), Ornitheology (The Word Works, 2018), [box] (Letter [r] Press, 2016), Tributary (Barrow Street, 2015), and Round Trip (Seven Kitchens, 2010). He won the 2015 Third Coast Poetry Prize and Gival Press’ 2016 Oscar Wilde Award, and his poems appear 
in numerous literary journals including: American Letters & Commentary, Colorado Review, Crazyhorse, Kenyon Review, West Branch, Western Humanities Review, and Witness. Kevin is a Financial Assistant in MIT’s Program in Art, Culture, and Technology.

MIT Program in Art, Culture and Technology graduate students have set up a temporary school as an intervention into the nested ecosystem of education at MIT. This school is a subsystem of education where students and the general public are invited to participate in ACT student-led classes, cinema cycles, exhibitions, discussions, conferences, fellowship, workshops, construction and celebrations throughout the month of February. The intervention uses the structures and conventions of a typical university to explore other ways of learning, sharing and building knowledge and community.
